title: "Age and Alzheimer’s disease affect functional connectivity along separate axes of functional brain organization"
abstract:  "Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are associated with alterations in functional connectivity (FC), yet their spatial and temporal dynamics remain debated. Whole-brain functional gradients, which organize regions along axes of functional similarity, are positioned here as a framework for understanding such alterations. Across two independent cohorts (N = 974, BioFINDER-2; N = 129, ADNI), we demonstrate that age- and AD-related hyper- and hypoconnectivity rarely occur in isolation; instead, they coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct principal gradients of functional brain organization. AD pathology is associated with hypoconnectivity in sensory-motor regions and hyperconnectivity in associative areas, aligning with the sensory-association axis; whereas aging shows hyperconnectivity in executive and hypoconnectivity in non-executive regions, aligning with the executive axis. Longitudinal and nonlinear analyses reveal that sensory-association alignment related to AD pathology happens early in the disease but diminishes with progression, instead becoming linked to worsening cognition. A relationship between poor cognition and sensory-association aligned hyper- and hypoconnectivity was also observed in clinically healthy older adults, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain rather than a pathology-specific effect. These findings highlight the fundamental role of functional organization in shaping hyper- and hypoconnectivity with aging, both in health and disease."

# Main

Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are both associated with changes in functional brain networks – groups of regions that typically communicate with one another to support cognition. However, the precise nature of these changes – their spatio-temporal dynamics, and whether they reflect compensatory adaptations, pathological disruptions, or both – remains a topic of active debate [@corriveau-lecavalier2024; @hillary2017]. Answering these questions is not only important for understanding disease biology, but could enable tailored clinical strategies that address age-independent mechanisms of AD. Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by pathological accumulation of amyloid-β and tau proteins. These proteins spread through the brain in characteristic patterns [@braak1991; @thal2002], leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Functional connectivity (FC), the temporal synchrony of activity between brain regions, may be both a perpetrator and a victim in this process: as a pathway facilitating the spread of pathology and as a system affected by it [@franzmeier2019; @franzmeier2020; @jones2016a; @ottoy2024; @vogel2023]. However, normal or healthy aging is also associated with altered functional connectivity [@chan2014; @damoiseaux2017; @deery2023; @filippi2023; @geerligs2015; @zhang2023]. These alterations have been proposed both as mechanisms to sustain cognitive function as the brain is challenged by stressors, and as a manifestation of pathological network breakdown [e.g. @bai2009a; @bajo2010a; @bakker2015; @elman2014a; @haberman2017; @hillary2017; @jones2016].

FC changes in aging and AD have commonly been studied through two approaches. One approach focuses on regional connectivity changes, such as increases or decreases within or between specific regions or networks, or between regions of interest and the rest of the brain [@biswal2010; @buckner2013; @cole2010; @rubinov2010]. Although consistent effects have been found, such as reduced FC within the default mode network in healthy aging [@damoiseaux2017], studies of aging, especially with AD, frequently report mixed patterns of hyper- and hypoconnectivity [among many: @berron2020; @berron2021; @chauveau2025; @damoiseaux2012; @dennis2014; @jockwitz2021; @ng2016a; @palmqvist2017; @santillo2024; @schultz2017]. Such mixed findings could arise if the relationship between connectivity and age or disease progression is nonlinear – that is, hyper- may shift to hypoconnectivity (or vice versa) depending on age or disease severity. While initial hyperconnectivity is often attributed to adaptive cognitive compensation [@hillary2017; @jones2016], the relationship between connectivity and cognition remains unclear. The common regional approach of FC research allows for precise and granular analyses, but is inherently limited in providing a unified, whole-brain perspective on functional changes in healthy and pathological aging.

The other common approach for studying FC changes in aging and AD adopts a more large-scale view, analyzing connectivity patterns by decomposing connectivity matrices into variance components, often referred to as ‘gradients’ [@margulies2016]. These components organize brain regions along axes of functional similarity, representing whole-cortex patterns of brain organization. The primary components capture the largest variations in the data, arranging regions along a continuum that groups areas with similar brain activity together, while placing regions with the greatest dissimilarities at opposite ends. For example, the sensory-association axis [@sydnor2021], which is often the primary variance component of FC, groups regions involved in sensory and motor functions (unimodal) on one end of the gradient spectrum, and those supporting higher-order associative cognition (transmodal) on the other. Typically, the second component spans the visual and motor cortices, while the third component groups executive networks at one end and all other networks at the opposite. A main feature of the gradients lies in capturing the brain’s functional architecture as continuous, overlapping maps ranking regions by their degree of involvement in distinct functional domains. But, the typical way to study gradients is in terms of how their expression changes, e.g. they become more pronounced during development [@sydnor2023; @pines2023] and less pronounced in age or with AD [@bethlehem2020; @hu2022a; @ottoy2024].

In this study, we do not treat gradients as the object of study, but instead use them as a framework to interpret the spatial distribution of connectivity changes in aging and AD. By doing so, we integrate the two dominant approaches outlined above, combining regional granularity with a large-scale functional perspective. However, capturing a comprehensive picture of how FC is altered by aging and AD requires consideration of not only where these changes occur, but also when. To address this, we model nonlinear region-wise trajectories of connectivity across age and along the AD continuum using a continuous biomarker-based measure of pathology, then examine how longitudinal increases in pathology affect connectivity. Finally, to determine whether these connectivity changes relate to cognition independently of age and pathology, we conduct separate analyses in cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired individuals. Altogether, this study provides a framework that leverages group-level functional gradients and a continuous biomarker-based pathology measure to examine the spatial distribution, cognitive relevance, and temporal progression of FC changes in aging and AD.

# Results

We analyzed resting-state fMRI data from the BioFINDER-2 cohort (974 participants) and validated findings using a subset of the ADNI-3 cohort (129 participants) with complete data (see Table 1 for participant characteristics). After parcellating the brain into 1000 regions [@schaefer2018] , FC was quantified using nodal affinity, the parcel-wise average of connectivity similarity to all other parcels (see Figure 1A and Methods). Nodal affinity was used as the outcome in various parcel-wise regression models, with the t-values of the terms of interest projected onto the cortical surface, resulting in “t-maps” (Figure 1A, C). Note that, for robustness, all results were also repeated using nodal connectivity strength, which showed very similar results (see Figure S1). Our goal was to assess the degree to which these t-maps aligned with the principal axes (i.e. gradients) of functional organization. Gradients were defined as the principal components of the average connectomes from healthy controls in each cohort. Supplementary analyses (Table S1) with gradients derived using various methods (including the traditional diffusion map embedding from @margulies2016) confirmed that this methodological choice did not alter the results to any great extent. The age- and AD-related t-maps were spatially compared to the first three gradients, and their relationship quantified with R² from simple univariable linear regression.

In Figure 1A and C, the main workflow of the study is described and results presented with age and clinical diagnosis as the variables of interest. Gradient 1 and 3 revealed strong spatial relationships to the parcelwise effects of diagnosis and age, respectively, and so we focus on these two gradients in subsequent analyses. The results shown in Figure 1C are noteworthy, particularly the strong relationship between MCI effects and Gradient 1. However, relying on clinical diagnostic criteria – common in aging versus AD comparisons – may confound pathological processes with cognitive factors (e.g., resilience). To explicitly isolate pathological AD effects, we used a continuous measure of pathology severity by nonlinearly mapping participants onto a continuous trajectory based on CSF Aβ and tau PET (Figure 1D) using the SCORPIUS method [@cannoodt] . This continuous pathology measure was used instead of clinical diagnoses to quantify AD disease progression in all subsequent analyses.

Mapping functional connectivity and pathology to cortical gradients in aging and Alzheimer’s disease. (A) Resting-state fMRI data for each subject were parcellated into 1000 regions (Schaefer et al., 2018). Timeseries from these parcels underwent pairwise Pearson correlation. The resulting connectivity matrix was then thresholded column-wise, retaining the 25% strongest connections. Negative correlations were zeroed out. Cosine pairwise similarity between these columns were then calculated and averaged across parcels, resulting in one FC value per parcel and subject (Margulies et al., 2016). This served as the outcome in parcelwise regression models, with t-values of the terms of interest (e.g., age, diagnosis) mapped onto the cortical surface in (C), forming t-maps. (B) Gradients were derived by averaging connectivity matrices of healthy controls and calculating principal components. The first three components/gradients were retained but only the first and third further analysed. (C) T-maps were compared to gradients, with the relationships quantified using R² from univariable linear regression. 95% parametric confidence intervals were based on the F-distribution’s non-centrality parameter. Results are shown for age and clinical diagnosis (MCI vs. CN, AD vs. CN), highlighting notable relationships to Gradients 1 and 3. (D) Participants were given a pathology score by mapping them nonlinearly onto a continuous pathology trajectory using Aβ and tau biomarkers using the SCORPIUS method (Cannoodt et al. 2016), providing a gradated alternative to clinical diagnoses for subsequent analyses (see Section 4.2.3 for details). The relationship (LOESS curves) between the pathology score and the scaled biomarkers used to derive it is shown to the left, and distributions of clinical diagnosis groups to the right.

##### Cross-sectional effects of age and AD pathology on functional connectivity align with distinct gradients

In the BioFINDER-2 cohort, the spatial distribution of nodal associations between FC and AD pathology aligned with Gradient 1 (R² = 0.55 \[0.51,0.58\]), reflecting decreases of FC in unimodal regions and increases in transmodal regions with increasing pathology. Age effects were instead aligned with Gradient 3 (R² = 0.55 \[0.52,0.59\]), with executive areas showing increasing and non-executive areas decreasing effects with increasing age (Figure 2A, Figure S2). Notably, age effects were not aligned with Gradient 1, and AD effects were not aligned with Gradient 3, suggesting a double dissociation. These findings were replicated in ADNI (Figure 2B) (Gradient 1 for pathology: R² = 0.30 \[0.25,0.34\]; Gradient 3 for age: R² = 0.46 \[0.42, 0.50\]). Separate analyses of within- and between-network affinity (Figure S3, Figure S4) revealed similar patterns to overall affinity, with generally weaker gradient relationships for within- compared to between-network affinity. This suggests that both contribute to the observed gradient alignments, but between-network connections play a greater role.

Age and AD pathology are associated with functional connectivity changes aligned with distinct organizational gradients. These dissociable alignments were observed in BioFINDER-2 (A), and in an external cohort, ADNI (B). Cortical maps display t-values from nodal linear regression models with nodal affinity as the outcome, using age and Alzheimer’s pathology as independent variables, covaried for sex and motion. Scatter plots show the relationship between t-values and gradient scores across nodes, colored by network membership, with R² values and their 95% parametric confidence intervals based on the F-distribution’s non-centrality parameter. Color scales on the axes match the corresponding cortical t-maps. See Figure S10 for network delineation of the cortical maps of A.

##### Connectivity effects and their alignment with gradients vary along the age- and pathology spectra

Prior literature focusing on FC in AD has identified regional increases in connectivity that are then followed by decreases (see @corriveau-lecavalier2024, and e.g. @schultz2017; @badhwar2017). Nonlinear relationships between age and FC have also been found (e.g. @ng2016). We therefore sought to investigate whether these nonlinearities were reflected in gradient-like FC changes as well. To explore these potential nonlinearities, generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted, with FC at each parcel as outcome and age, pathology and covariates as predictors. Derivatives of these models represent the effect direction and strength (i.e., slope) for each term at each of its values. Looking at the slopes for all parcels at a given term value gives us a cortical “slope-map” indicating the strength and effect direction of all parcels at that term value. This allows us to observe how these effects vary continuously across the age and pathology spectra. For pathology, the relationship between Gradient 1 and the slope-maps increased up to a pathology level of \~0.25 (representing early AD pathology), remaining relatively high until \~0.5 (representing middle-stages of AD pathology), after which it declined sharply with further accumulation (Figure 3B.2). For age, the relationship between Gradient 3 and the slope-maps remained high between ages 55 and 70, but essentially vanished after age 80. These results suggest that gradient-like FC patterns emerge as an initial response to pathological or physiological changes but diminish as these changes progress.

Parcel-wise trajectories, averaged across relevant gradient ventiles, are shown in Figure 3B.3. Across the pathology spectrum, averaged FC in transmodal ventiles increased relatively linearly, while FC in unimodal ventiles decreased at a similar rate. Unimodal ventiles consistently exhibited higher FC than transmodal. Across age, FC increased in executive ventiles and decreased in non-executive ventiles. While executive ventiles had lower FC than non-executive regions in younger age, this pattern reversed in older age.

Nonlinear models reveal that the alignment of age- and pathology-related FC effects with organizational gradients varies across the age and AD pathology continuum. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted for each parcel, with nodal affinity as the outcome and age and AD pathology as smooth terms, controlling for sex and motion. Predicted trajectories and their derivatives were calculated.

##### Longitudinal pathology increase leads to gradient aligned connectivity changes

A subset of participants in the BioFINDER-2 sample (N = 378) had longitudinal data available for all variables except CSF Aβ. To determine whether the gradient-aligned FC changes from previous analyses truly reflect within-subject responses to pathology, we fit linear mixed-effects models. Since longitudinal CSF Aβ data were unavailable, the pathology score was re-calculated using only tau PET from Braak I-II, III-IV and V-VI regions of interest. The baseline effects in this sample (Figure 4A) closely mirrored the previous findings. The longitudinal change in pathology (Δ pathology) also showed gradient-aligned connectivity changes (G1: R²=0.25 \[0.21, 0.29\]; and interestingly G3: R²=0.21 \[0.17, 0.26\]), confirming that within-subject pathology accumulation is associated with within-subject FC increases and decreases along organisational axes.

To explore whether the previously identified nonlinearities were also reflected longitudinally, we employed a sliding window approach, examining how gradient alignment varies across different baseline ages and pathology levels. Figure 4B provides a methodological overview, and Figure 4C displays the gradient alignment (correlation values) for each window and term. For clarity, we only present the relevant gradient correlations for each term as indicated by our prior cross-sectional analyses, though Figure S5 provides both. Age-windowing revealed increasing Gradient 3 correlations for baseline age across all age windows, suggesting that a 25-year interval is long enough to capture this effect across most of the adult lifespan. Baseline pathology effects remained consistently aligned with Gradient 1 across all age windows beyond 40 years. The within-subject pathology change (Δ pathology) showed the strongest Gradient 1 alignment at approximately the same age window as baseline pathology, but decreased somewhat in older age.

Across the pathology windows, baseline age showed a decreasing association with Gradient 3, with weaker correlations in windows containing higher baseline pathology. Baseline pathology effects, in contrast, initially increased in alignment with Gradient 1 before declining at higher pathology levels, echoing findings from the cross-sectional GAM analysis. Interestingly, Δ pathology followed a similar trajectory but preceded the baseline pathology effect, peaking and declining in earlier pathology windows. Overall, these findings corroborate and extend our cross-sectional results, demonstrating that AD pathology-related FC changes have a temporal dynamic. Within-subject increases in tau pathology are initially associated with connectivity changes along Gradient 1, but this relationship weakens as baseline pathology advances. Moreover, the stronger Δ pathology effects at lower pathology windows, compared to baseline pathology, suggest that gradient-aligned connectivity changes may indicate emerging pathology.

Within subject change in pathology is related to gradient aligned connectivity effects. A: A linear mixed-effects model was applied at each parcel, with FC as the outcome and baseline age, baseline pathology (tau PET SUVR from Braak I-VI), Δ pathology (longitudinal change in tau PET from baseline) as fixed effects and random intercepts for subjects, covaried for time since baseline, sex and scanner motion. Cortical maps display t-values from the parcel-wise models, while scatter plots show the relationship between t-values and gradient scores, colored by network membership, with R² values and 95% parametric confidence intervals based on the F-distribution’s non-centrality parameter. Color scales of the cortical maps are shown along the axes of the scatter plots. B: Schematic of the sliding window approach used to assess longitudinal nonlinearities in the relationship between FC and gradients across the aging and pathology spectra. The heatmap represents a bivariate histogram with 30 breaks along each variable with the color of the tiles indicating the number of subjects within that specific baseline age and pathology group. Age windows spanned 25 years and were incremented by 1 year, while pathology windows spanned 0.35 pathology score units and were incremented by 0.015, resulting in 44 age windows and 45 pathology windows, all having ≥ 25 subjects. For each window we fit linear mixed models at the parcel level, t-maps for each fixed effect of interest were extracted and the t-maps correlated (Pearson correlation) with Gradient 1 and 3. C: Results of the sliding window analysis showing the dynamic relationship of AD pathology on FC gradient alignment. The correlation values on the scatters are smoothed with generalized additive models (k=5), and the window number (i.e., 1 for the first window, 2 for the second, etc.) as the predictor. For the age terms in each windowing, correlations are shown between the t-map and Gradient 3, while for the pathology terms, they are shown between the t-maps and Gradient 1. Marginal plots show the sample size for each window. Results from the age windowing show that baseline age and pathology effects on Gradients 3 and 1, respectively, are mostly stable across the adult lifespan. Across the pathology windows, baseline pathology effects increase in gradient alignment over the initial windows after which they decrease. This pattern was mirrored in Δ pathology, but the within subject change preceded the baseline effects with peaks and declines in earlier windows.

##### Gradient-aligned FC patterns reflect cognitive status

In the previous analyses, we linked gradient-like connectivity alterations to two factors known to affect cognition: age and AD. However, these analyses did not directly examine the relationship between connectivity and cognitive performance, which is essential for understanding the implications of these findings. To assess the cognitive relevance of the spatial dynamics uncovered, we examined the association between FC and cognitive performance in two groups: cognitively healthy, CSF Aβ 42/40-negative APOE ε4 non-carriers (N = 310) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (N = 259). Cognitive performance was measured using a modified Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (mPACC) score [@donohue2014], zero-normalized to a healthy control group over 60 (see Section 4.2.2 for details).

In the healthy group, node-wise linear regression was conducted with mean centered age, (inverted) mPACC and their interaction as predictors. Due to common age-related tau accumulation, we adjusted for pathology load in the healthy group (see Figure S6 for analyses without this adjustment and distribution of Tau SUVR within this group). Results (Figure 5A) confirmed alignment of age effects with Gradient 3 (R² = 0.39 \[0.35, 0.43\]). This alignment between Gradient 3 and age was also present for worse cognition, though it was weaker (R² = 0.22 \[0.18, 0.26\]). This means that, at the sample mean age (62 years), people with poorer cognition have more of a Gradient 3-like FC pattern. The interaction between age and cognition, however, showed a Gradient 1-like pattern (R² = 0.42) – meaning that older people with poor cognition have more of a Gradient 1-like FC pattern. Surprisingly, we found that the (tau driven) AD pathology in the cognitively healthy group also aligned with Gradient 1 (R² = 0.61), again suggesting that gradient-aligned connectivity changes may indicate emerging pathology.

In the cognitively impaired group, parcel-wise regression was performed to examine FC associations with AD pathology and (inverted) mPACC, adjusted for age. Surprisingly, the spatial distribution of AD effects no longer resembled a Gradient 1-like pattern in this group. Instead, a Gradient 1-like pattern emerged for worse cognition, regardless of pathology load or age (Figure 5B). This suggests that in the clinical phase of AD, cognitive difficulties are more directly related to Gradient 1-aligned connectivity changes than to pathology itself. Supplementary analyses (Figure S7) confirmed that adding an interaction between pathology and cognition did not alter this main effect.

Cognitive status modifies the relationship between AD pathology, age, and functional connectivity changes along Gradient 1. Cross-sectional results are shown for cognitively unimpaired Aβ-, APOE ε4 non-carriers (A) and cognitively impaired individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (B). In A, models include age, pathology, cognition (mPACC), and an age × cognition interaction (with centered predictors and inverted cognition scores for interpretability). In B, models include age, pathology, and cognition without interactions. Tau-driven AD pathology in cognitively unimpaired individuals is associated with Gradient-1-like FC changes, but this relationship diminishes in the MCI/AD group. Instead, in this group, worse cognition (mPACC in B) is associated with Gradient-1-like changes, similar to the effects seen in older cognitively unimpaired individuals, i.e. the interaction in (A).

# Discussion

This study demonstrates that age- and AD-related changes in functional connectivity are fundamentally shaped by macro-scale brain organization. Our findings offer a whole-brain perspective of connectivity alterations free from constraints imposed by predefined network borders or arbitrary statistical thresholds, allowing us to reinterpret previous, often contradictory, studies. We highlight that hyper- and hypoconnectivity rarely occur in isolation; instead, they coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct principal gradients of functional brain organization. These results were replicated in an external cohort, confirmed longitudinally, and across multiple methodological choices. Further, we demonstrate that these gradient-aligned spatial patterns shift dynamically with age and with severity of AD pathology. For instance, connectivity changes aligned with Gradient 1 emerge as an early response to AD pathology, even before clinically detectable impairment, but diminish once clinical impairment develops. At this later stage, Gradient 1 alignment more directly reflects cognitive difficulties rather than pathology itself, possibly signaling cognitive aspects of disease progression. A similar relationship between Gradient 1-aligned connectivity and cognitive difficulties appeared in clinically healthy older adults. Taken together, our results suggest that Gradient 1 alignment could serve as a neural indicator of cognitive strain even before clinical impairment becomes evident.

The broad, cortex-wide patterns of connectivity changes revealed in this study illustrate a balancing scale of age-related connectivity increases and decreases, anchored at the centers of Gradients 1 and 3 for AD and aging, respectively. Connectivity changes in one functional domain, as captured by these gradients, are mirrored by less or opposing changes in its “opposite” domain. This dynamic is particularly noteworthy when considering the cognitive domains affected by AD and aging, which align closely with Gradients 1 and 3, respectively. AD primarily impairs episodic memory, a function linked to the default mode and limbic networks [@buckner2008]. These networks, together with the control network, are located on the end of Gradient 1 that generally tended to show increases in FC with early AD pathology. In contrast, normal aging leaves autobiographical memory relatively unaffected [@hedden2004] and predominantly affects executive functions [@buckner2004], which are closely linked to the dorsal attention, control and salience networks [@uddin2019]. These cognitive differences also mirror structural vulnerabilities, with AD primarily affecting medial temporal regions and normal aging primarily frontal regions [@hedden2004; @pichetbinette2020]. The dorsal attention and control networks, together with the visual network, are all located at the end of Gradient 3 that generally tended to show increases in FC with age. This systematic reallocation of connectivity may indicate a shift of resource allocation [@hillary2017] and offers a cognitively meaningful interpretation of the gradients, extending their relevance beyond mere organization, to encompass functional or cognitive vulnerabilities or adaptations in the context of aging and AD.

The literature describing FC alterations in aging and AD is highly heterogeneous [@badhwar2017; @ferreira2013; @jockwitz2021]. Our results suggest that previously observed region- or network-specific effects are likely manifestations of broader, structured changes. The structured, gradient-like changes we demonstrate overlap with consistent findings in the literature. For instance, hypoconnectivity within the default mode [@damoiseaux2017; @wang2010] and salience networks – particularly in the opercular insula [@hausman2020; @jockwitz2021; @onoda2012] – has been frequently documented in healthy aging. Yet, another common finding: hypoconnectivity within the dorsal attention network [@jockwitz2021], contrasts with the hyperconnectivity observed in the present study. This discrepancy might reflect the omission of age-related tau pathology as a covariate in typical healthy aging studies (although, our results remain largely unchanged when not controlling for age-related tau pathology: Figure S6). Indeed, we show here that tau levels affect FC even in cognitively normal, Aβ negative individuals, and are particularly associated with decreased connectivity in the dorsal attention network.

Regarding AD, we observed widespread pathology-related connectivity reductions in unimodal areas – a finding documented previously [@zhan2016; @dipasquale2015; @li2011], yet often overlooked, potentially due to a literature bias towards DMN-related changes [@badhwar2017]. Consistent with past studies [@bai2009; @corriveau-lecavalier2024; @damoiseaux2012; @elman2014; @putcha2011; @schultz2017], we observed DMN hyperconnectivity in early and preclinical AD, which have been reported even in genetically predisposed individuals [@filippini2009; @quiroz2010; @sheline2010; @westlye2011]. Conversely, DMN hypoconnectivity is also frequently reported [@agosta2012; @binnewijzend2012; @balthazar2014; @brier2012; @gili2011; @liu2014; @wang2013; @damoiseaux2012]. Previous reports [@schultz2017; @damoiseaux2012; @jones2016] have suggested that initial hyperconnectivity early on in the disease may give way to hypoconnectivity as the disease advances, perhaps resolving this discrepancy. Such temporal dynamics, with initial hyperconnectivity, are not unique to AD [@hillary2017] having also been observed in Parkinson’s disease [@gorges2015; @stoffers2008], multiple sclerosis [@faivre2012; @roosendaal2010], and traumatic brain injury [@hillary2014]. Although hyperconnectivity may initially serve an adaptive purpose, chronic hyperconnectivity has been argued to become detrimental due to sustained metabolic stress [@hillary2017] or facilitating the spread of pathology [@jones2016]. Indeed, @jones2016 suggest the hyperconnectivity to ultimately drive the hypoconnectivity observed in AD. Supporting this "phasic" view, our nonlinear analysis showed that gradient alignment peaked at moderate pathology levels before declining as pathology burden increased further. Our longitudinal analysis further reinforced this, demonstrating that within-subject pathology accumulation (Δ pathology) also induces gradient-aligned FC changes, but that this relationship disappears for individuals with higher baseline pathology.

Strikingly, the relationship between pathology load and Gradient 1-aligned connectivity was entirely absent in MCI and AD patients. Instead, Gradient 1 alignment became associated with poorer cognitive performance in this group. A similar relationship to cognition also emerged among clinically unimpaired older adults. Previous studies have linked hyperconnectivity in the DMN with subjective cognitive decline [@pievani2024], as well as sensory-motor hyper- and hypoconnectivity with better and worse cognitive performance, respectively [@chen2022; @greene2018; @kebets2019]. Together, these findings could suggest that the Gradient 1-related FC patterns we observed could indeed represent a harmful state, indicating increased vulnerability to pathological processes leading to cognitive decline. But it could alternatively be interpreted as individuals experiencing underlying cognitive difficulties – potentially due to comorbidities or less cognitive resilience – requiring greater compensatory adaptations. These interpretations are not mutually exclusive. Intervention studies with repeated imaging and detailed cognitive testing over time [@bakker2015; @haberman2017; @rios2022] will be necessary to disentangle the temporal dynamics of these interactions to assess if the gradient-like FC alterations are compensatory, harmful, or both.

Regardless of interpretation, gradient-like FC alterations appear to signal ongoing physiological or pathological processes, potentially reflecting underlying cognitive strain. Although resting-state fMRI and FC has often been proposed as a biomarker for AD [@balthazar2014], its practical effectiveness remains limited [@hohenfeld2018]. Our findings indicate that examining whole-cortex patterns of FC, particularly using gradient alignment, may enhance the utility of fMRI for this purpose. Not as a disease-specific marker, but rather as a tool to detect and monitor clinically subtle cognitive changes. Thus, FC analyses interpreted using gradients might enable early identification of cognitive vulnerability before clinical symptoms emerge, as indicated by AD (tau) pathology even in the clinically healthy group showing a marked Gradient 1-alignment. Beyond this clinical implication, our results also offer conceptual clarity for FC research more broadly. Rather than viewing gradients as outcomes, this study demonstrates their value as interpretative frameworks for understanding how brain function adapts or responds to aging and disease processes. The strength of this study lies in its large, single-site main cohort and the several methods employed to validate the findings within it, including an external replication, nonlinear, and longitudinal linear and nonlinear analyses. By using a whole-brain perspective and continuous measures of pathology, we overcome the limitations of region-specific analyses and categorical diagnostic classifications. However, this study also has several limitations. First, combining multiple pathology measures to map a disease trajectory obscures potential pathology-specific effects that could have been of interest. Second, our whole-brain approach overcomes biases inherent in region- or network-specific analyses but limits the ability to pinpoint specific connections driving the gradient-aligned patterns. Third, resting-state connectivity has a weaker relationship to cognition compared to task-based paradigms [@elliott2019; @greene2018]; future studies should explore whether task-based FC strengthens or refines the findings of this study. Lastly, as an observational study, causal inferences regarding the relationship between functional connectivity, pathology, and cognitive decline is limited.

In sum, we find that age- and AD-related FC alterations align with distinct large-scale cortical gradients of functional organization. These alignments vary along the age and AD pathology spectra, and are associated with cognition independent of AD pathology. We suggest that gradient-like FC changes may represent a general neural response to cognitive strain or system stress, though whether this response is compensatory remains unknown. We show that they emerge in older individuals, those with subtle AD pathology, and clinically impaired patients alike where cognitive demands may outpace available neural resources.

<!-- First, its exploratory nature introduces certain drawbacks compared to hypothesis-driven approaches. However, validating our findings in both an external cohort and longitudinally within the primary cohort mitigates many of these concerns. -->

<!-- Although we seem sure that the FC changes represent compensation, the nature of hyperconnectivity is debated [@corriveau-lecavalier2024], with competing interpretations suggesting it may either reflect compensatory adaptations or pathological disruptions to the brain’s network architecture. From the compensatory perspective, it may represent a response to neuronal dysfunction, involving the recruitment of atypical regions or the synchronization of activity across larger areas to compensate for impaired cognitive processes in affected regions [e.g., @elman2014; @bajo2010; @bai2009]. Supporting this view, we observe connectivity declines in areas not typically associated with the cognitive domains affected by age and AD, suggesting they may reflect an active reorganization process to conserve metabolic resources and maintain efficiency. Such mechanisms might explain the observed increases in connectivity between networks in the present study, and "de-modularization" reported generally across age and AD studies [@ewers2021; @deery2023; @betzel2014]. I.e. network integration might not in itself be a detrimental process but rather just reflective of resource reallocation. However, evidence from pharmacological interventions using antiepileptic drugs that reduce hippocampal activity suggests that hyperactivity may reflect a pathological state, disrupting network efficiency [@haberman2017; @bakker2015]. From this perspective, hyperconnectivity driving network integration would signify an over-engagement of brain regions, leading to redundancy and loss of functional specialization and thereby cognitive decline. -->

<!-- Our findings suggest that age- and AD-related connectivity changes, whether compensatory or pathological, have strong cognitive relevance. In cognitively challenged populations -- whether older and healthy or clinically impaired -- individuals with worse cognitive performance exhibited a more pronounced Gradient 1-like FC pattern. This aligns with prior studies linking Gradient 1-like connectivity to worse fluid intelligence [@zhao2023], hyperconnectivity in the DMN to subjective cognitive decline [@pievani2024], and sensory-motor hyper- and hypoconnectivity to better and worse cognitive performance respectively [@chen2022; @greene2018; @kebets2019]. Interestingly, in cognitively healthy younger individuals, the Gradient 1-like pattern was unrelated to cognition but strongly associated with tau-driven AD pathology. This suggests that the Gradient 1-like pattern may reflect an initial adaptive response to cognitive stress caused by the pathology, delaying cognitive decline and obscuring subtle impairments. However, as individuals progress into clinically noticeable decline they may surpass a critical threshold where compensation can no longer keep pace with the cognitive challenges posed by the high load of pathology. As a result, this indirect relationship disappears, and the compensatory Gradient 1-like pattern shifts to reflect a more direct relationship with cognition, as the brain's struggle to preserve function now primarily drives the changes. Similarly, in older adults without clinical impairment the relationship between worse cognition and Gradient 1 may reflect the increased compensatory demands of aging. Conversely, having less of a Gradient 1-like FC pattern is seemingly related to better cognitive performance (within the "challenged" populations), potentially suggesting that individuals with greater cognitive reserve or resilience may require fewer compensatory adjustments. Understanding how factors like education or other known markers of resilience modulate these patterns could provide important knowledge for tailoring interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function across aging and AD alike. -->

<!-- Within the broader context of aging and Alzheimer’s disease research on functional connectivity, much of the literature has focused on identifying isolated effects, often overlooking the broader patterns they form. Yet, the brain is a densely interconnected, dynamic system – where the dysregulation of a single region can ripple outward, like a drop in still water, sending waves across the entire system. In this study, we offer a comprehensive perspective on the intricate interplay between functional connectivity effects and brain organization and show that this seems to be cognitively relevant. We hope that this lays the groundwork for future research to harness these connectivity relationships for targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies. -->

<!-- In sum, we find that age- and AD-related FC changes align systematically with large-scale cortical gradients, providing a unifying framework to reconcile prior conflicting findings. Importantly, we demonstrate that these gradient-aligned patterns reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain rather than being driven solely by AD pathology. This relationship emerges in older individuals and clinically impaired groups alike, underscoring its relevance across the aging and disease continuum. By capturing both the spatial organization and non-linear dynamics of FC changes, this study offers novel insights into brain reorganization under cognitive pressure and highlights the potential of gradients to detect early, cognitively relevant network alterations. -->

<!-- In sum, we find that age- and AD-related FC alterations align with large-scale cortical gradients, clarifying discrepancies in the literature. These alignments vary along the age and AD pathology spectra, and are associated with cognition independent of AD pathology. Rather than reflecting purely compensatory or detrimental changes, these gradient-aligned patterns may represent a general neural response to cognitive strain or system stress, emerging in older individuals, those with subtle AD pathology, and clinically impaired patients alike where cognitive demands may outpace available neural resources. -->

## Sample

**BioFINDER**. Information regarding recruitment, diagnostic criteria, and Aβ positivity assessment for the BioFINDER II cohort (https://biofinder.se/) has been described in detail previously [@leuzy2020; @palmqvist2020]. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Lund University, Lund, Sweden, with additional permissions for PET imaging granted by the Swedish Medicines and Products Agency and the local Radiation Safety Committee at Skåne University Hospital, Sweden. For the cross-sectional analysis, 1,168 individuals had all necessary data available (fMRI, CSF Aβ 40/42, and tau PET). However, as described in the Imaging section, a stringent in-scanner motion filter was applied, excluding 194 individuals and leaving a final cross-sectional sample of N = 974. Of these, 655 were cognitively unimpaired or had self-reported cognitive decline (SCD), while 319 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Cognitively impaired cases were included only if they were Aβ-positive, as assessed by abnormal CSF Aβ 40/42 values. For the longitudinal analysis, 480 individuals had fMRI and tau PET data from at least two visits. After applying the motion filter, 378 unique individuals with at least two data points remained. See tables Table 1 and Table 2 for additional details.

For the cross-sectional analysis `r bf_cs_tot_unfilt` individuals had all necessary variables available (fMRI, CSF Aβ 40/42 and tau PET), however, as described in the [fMRI](#fmri-bf) data section, we applied a stringent in-scanner motion filter which removed `r bf_cs_tot_unfilt - bf_cs_tot_filt` individuals at baseline, leaving us with a total cross-sectional sample of *N* = `r bf_cs_tot_filt` individuals, `r n_cs_bf_cn` of those were cognitively unimpaired or had self-reported cognitive decline (SCD), while `r n_cs_bf_imp` had been diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Only cognitively impaired cases with Aβ positivity as assessed by abnormal Aβ 40/42 CSF values were included. For the longitudinal analysis `r bf_long_tot_unfilt` individuals had fMRI and tau PET data from at least two visits, but after filtering for scanner motion `r bf_long_tot_filt` unique individuals with at least two data points remained. Longitudinal data were for the most part unavailable for Aβ 40/42 CSF. Therefore, a pathology measure was estimated based on Tau PET only, as described in @sec-patscore. See table @tbl-table1 and @tbl-table2 for more details. -->

**ADNI**. Information related to participant consent in The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative can be found at (ADNI; <http://adni.loni.usc.edu>).

A total sample of *N =* `r n_adni_tot` had the exact same variables available as in the discovery cohort (CSF Aβ 40/42, tau PET, fMRI), with two individuals being filtered out for scanner motion. Of those, there were 89 healthy controls and 40 participants diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. All cognitively impaired cases were Aβ-positive as assessed by abnormal Aβ40/42 CSF or amyloid PET. See table Table 1 for further details.

## Data acquisition and processing

### CSF and APOE ε4 carriership

**BioFINDER**: CSF Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels in BioFINDER were measured using the Roche Elecsys platform (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd., Basel, Switzerland), as described in [@janelidze2019]. Aβ positivity was determined by Gaussian mixture modeling, using a cutoff of \<0.080, previously described in [@palmqvist2020; @pichetbinette2022]. Participants who carried at least one copy of the APOE ε4 allele were defined as APOE ε4 carriers.

**ADNI**: CSF Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels in ADNI were measured using the Roche Elecsys platform with Elecsys CSF immunoassays on a cobase 601 analyzer at the University of Pennsylvania, as described in @shaw2024. Aβ positivity was determined using previously established cut-offs derived in ??. APOE genotyping was performed using blood samples, and participants carrying at least one APOE ε4 allele were classified as APOE ε4 carriers. See @shaw2024 for further details on CSF analysis and APOE genotyping in ADNI.

### Cognitive assessment {#sec-metcog}

Estimation of cognitive performance using the modified Preclinical Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite [mPACC; @donohue2014] in BioFINDER has been previously described [@mattsson-carlgren2020]. It is the average of five z-scores from the cognitive tests: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) delayed recall (weighted double), Animal Fluency, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).

### Pathology score {#sec-patscore}

As with our previous work [@pichetbinette2024], a pathology score representing accumulated AD neuropathology was calculated using the R package SCORPIUS [@SCORPIUS]. The variables included were the CSF Aβ42/40-ratio, together with PET SUVR from regions reflecting Braak I-II, III-IV and V-IV as defined by @cho2016. SCORPIUS is a trajectory inference algorithm designed to nonlinearly project high-dimensional data onto a single continuous path. Briefly, pairwise Euclidean distances between observations were calculated. The resultant distance matrix was then decomposed and three components retained. Each individual is hence represented by coordinates in this three-dimensional space. Observations were then clustered into four clusters using k-means and the shortest path going through all cluster centers found. A principal curve was then iteratively fitted to the data to model the progression trajectory. Each participant was projected onto this curve to assign a pathology score reflecting its position along the inferred trajectory. See Figure 1D for estimation of the pathology measures as a function of the combined pathology score and distribution of patient groups over it. For the longitudinal pathology score, since longitudinal CSF Aβ 40/42 data was largely unavailable, only tau PET SUVR from the three Braak meta ROIs (I-II, III-IV and V-VI) were used.

### Imaging {#sec-imaging}

#### MRI and Tau PET

**BioFINDER**. Structural MRI was conducted using a Siemens 3T MAGNETOM Prisma scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with a 64-channel head coil. T1-weighted images (Magnetization Prepared – Rapid Gradient Echo, MPRAGE) were acquired with the following parameters: in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm², slice thickness = 1 mm, repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.54 ms, flip-angle = 9°.

All resting-state fMRI data (eyes closed) were acquired using a 3D echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with an in-plane resolution of 3×3 mm and slice thickness 3.6 mm; echo time = 30ms, and flip-angle = 63°. Scan time was 7.85 minutes, with a multiband repetition time of 1020 ms, resulting in 462 frames per scan before processing and censoring. Preprocessing has briefly been described in [@berron2021]. The processing was performed using a modified CPAC [@craddock2013towards] pipeline, building mostly on FSL [@jenkinson2012], AFNI [@cox1996] and ANTS [@avants2014]. Skullstripping was done with in-house code using the T2 structural image as a primer and Brain Surface Extractor from BrainSuite [@shattuck2002]. The fMRI preprocessing included slice-timing and motion correction. Physiological noise was regressed out using CompCor [@behzadi2007], alongside the removal of linear and quadratic trends. Additionally, regression of Friston’s 24-parameter motion correction [@friston1996], white matter and CSF signals were performed. Susceptibility distortion was corrected by unwarping the functional data using a nonlinear diffeomorphic transformation (performed with ANTS) of the mean functional image to high resolution (1 × 1 × 1 mm3) T2 structural image [@wang2017]. This transformation was then applied to each volume in the fMRI timeseries. Finally, a bandpass filter (0.01-0.1 Hz) was applied, and images transformed from native to MNI space with ANTS. For each scan, frames were censored based on DVARS for that frame lying outside 1.5\*IQR above and below the third and first quartiles, respectively [@power2012]. To avoid distortion from the outlier frames, they were interpolated before bandpass filtering and then removed from the final 4D image. Finally, any participant with an average FD \> 0.3mm or maximum FD \> 3mm over the entire sequence were filtered out before analysis.

Tau PET acquisition has been described in detail by @smith2020. Briefly, participants were injected with an average of 365 ± 20 MBq \[18F\]RO948, and emission data was acquired between 70 and 90 minutes post-injection, adjusted for the tracer’s pharmacokinetics. Low-dose CT scans were conducted before PET scans for attenuation correction. PET data was reconstructed using the VPFX-S algorithm (ordered subset expectation maximization with time-of-flight and point spread function corrections). The LIST mode data was binned into 4 × 5-minute time frames, and images were motion-corrected, summed, and co-registered to corresponding T1-weighted MRI images. FreeSurfer parcellation (v6; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu.ludwig.lub.lu.se/) was applied to extract regional uptake values, normalized to the mean uptake in inferior cerebellar grey matter.

**ADNI**. Image processing for ADNI has been described in @franzmeier2020 . Briefly, MRI data were collected using 3T scanners with unified scanning protocols that can be accessed here: https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ADNI3-MRI-protocols.pdf. Structural MRI was acquired with a 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (1 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 2300 ms).

Two protocols exist for the resting state EPI-BOLD sequence in ADNI: Basic (220x220x163 mm voxels) and Advanced (220x220x160 mm voxels). Depending on which protocol a participant has been subjected to, the parameters vary. Both protocols have an approximate scanner time of 10 minutes. The Basic protocol has a TR/TE/flip angle=3000/30/90° and the Advanced a TR/TE/flip angle=600/30/53°, so the number of frames differ depending on the protocol and ranges from approximately 200 to 1000. Processing steps described in Franzmeier et al. (2020) included motion correction, as well as regression of six motion parameters and mean signal from CSF and white matter. Trends were removed and a (0.01–0.08Hz) band-pass filter was applied. Images were nonlinearly registered to MNI space with coregistration to the baseline T1 image. After timeseries had been extracted, rows from high motion frames (\> 0.5mm framewise displacement) were censored. These rows, together with one preceding and two subsequent, were removed. Out of the 131 subjects with a full set of variables (CSF Aβ 40/42, tau PET, fMRI), one individual was filtered out due to a maximum number of frames \< 100 and one participant with an average FD \> 0.3mm or maximum FD \> 3mm over the entire sequence was filtered out before analysis.

Tau PET imaging in ADNI3 was performed using \[\^18F\]AV-1451 (Flortaucipir). Participants received an injection of 370 MBq (±10%), and emission data was acquired 75 minutes post-injection. Scans were conducted for 30 minutes in six 5-minute frames. Images were reconstructed using iterative algorithms specific to each scanner model, incorporating corrections for scatter, attenuation, and motion artifacts. CT scans or transmission scans were performed for attenuation correction prior to emission imaging. More detailed information can be accessed here https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ADNI3_PET-Tech-Manual_V2.0_20161206.pdf.

<!-- DVARS quantifies the change in BOLD signal intensity from one frame to the next by calculating the root mean square of the voxel-wise differences between consecutive timepoints. It is sensitive to how motion and other factors impact the signal [@power2012]. The main difference between using DVARS rather than framewise displacement (FD) for censoring frames is that DVARS targets the signal directly. FD helps in assessing the physical displacement of the head between frames, providing a measure of how much the head has moved but does not indicate the impact of this on the BOLD signal. Approximated motion (i.e. FD) can in some cases be high without actually affecting the signal; and small but unluckily timed motion can affect the signal but still yield low FD. Due to this discrepancy DVARS was chosen for censoring. (?? remove prior section). -->

##### Assessment of functional connectivity

In both BioFINDER and ADNI, parcelwise timeseries were extracted using the 1000-region Schaefer atlas [@schaefer2018], a cortical parcellation based on functional connectivity patterns and spatial contiguity. The timeseries were smoothed using a full-width at half-maximum kernel of 6 mm in BioFINDER and 4 mm in ADNI. After scaling the raw timeseries, pairwise Pearson correlations were computed between parcels, resulting in 10001000 correlation matrices representing co-activation patterns. Negative correlations were set to zero. FC was quantified primarily as nodal affinity [@margulies2016], where each connectome was column-wise thresholded to retain the 25% strongest connections, and cosine similarity was calculated between columns to yield a matrix of connectivity similarity. This approach shifts the interpretation slightly from similarity of brain activity to similarity of connectivity patterns, however, these two are very closely aligned in practice. @margulies2016 used a threshold retaining the 10% strongest connections, while we opted for a more liberal threshold due to the coarser resolution of using 1000 parcels instead of surface vertices.

Nodal affinity reduces the rank of the original correlation matrix, emphasizing the dominant variance patterns, while remaining interpretable. Averaging the affinity matrix across parcels then produces a metric that reflects how generic or specialized a parcel’s connectivity profile is relative to the whole brain: high values indicate broad similarity, while low values suggest unique connectivity patterns. Affinity is widely used in functional gradient studies because it is traditionally the underlying matrix from which the gradients are derived [@margulies2016]. For comparison, nodal connectivity strength (global brain connectivity) – the parcelwise average of the original connectivity matrices – was also calculated. All main analyses were replicated with nodal strength as the outcome, yielding results comparable to those with nodal affinity (see Figure S1). Additionally, we replicated our findings using correlation instead of cosine similarity on unthresholded connectivity matrices, which also yielded comparable results (see Figure S8). In Figure S3 and Figure S4, we run the main analyses with nodal affinity calculated within and between each Yeo 7 network, respectively, by taking the average affinity values of each parcel within its own network, and the average of each parcel’s affinity to parcels outside of its own network.

<!-- In both BioFINDER and ADNI, extraction of parcelwise timeseries was done using the @schaefer2018 1000 atlas, smoothed using a full width at half maximum kernel of 6 and 4 mm, respectively. The atlas is a parcellation of the cortical surface in 1000 regions based on functional connectivity patterns while taking spatial contiguity into account. The raw time-series were then scaled and the pairwise Pearson correlation taken between each parcel in the atlas, resulting in a $1000*1000$ correlation matrix indicating the co-activation patterns of the cerebral cortex. All negative correlations were set to 0. -->

<!-- FC was quantified as nodal affinity, where each individual connectome is column-wise thresholded to retain the top 25% of strongest connections while setting the rest to zero. Cosine similarity was then calculated between each column in the matrix, yielding a matrix of pairwise connectivity similarity. While the interpretation of this matrix shifts slightly -- from direct similarity of brain activity to similarity of connectivity patterns -- these two concepts are closely aligned in real-world scenarios. The primary advantage of this measure is that it reduces the rank of the original correlation matrix, which contributes to noise suppression, improved stability, and regularization, while still remaining interpretable. The parcel-wise averaging of the affinity matrix produces a metric that captures how generic versus specialized a parcel’s connectivity profile is relative to the whole brain. High values indicate that a region’s connectivity profile is broadly similar to many other regions, while low values suggest more distinct or unique connectivity patterns. It is worth noting that affinity is commonly used in studies focusing on functional gradients because it is traditionally the underlying matrix of their derivation [@margulies2016]. Consequently, gradients in the literature predominantly capture variance in connectivity similarity rather than direct connectivity. -->

<!-- Another common quantification of FC is nodal connectivity strength, or global brain connectivity -- the parcel-wise average of the individual connectivity matrices, representing the magnitude of a node's synchrony with other nodes across the cortex. This measure was also calculated and all main analyses replicated with it as outcome. The results are presented in @suppfig-strength and were comparable to the results with nodal affinity as outcome.  -->

<!-- Our findings show that regions with positive effects in connectivity strength exhibit even stronger positive effects in affinity, while regions with negative effects show either no change or slightly weaker effects in affinity. This difference suggests that affinity may capture processes that are not evident in connectivity strength alone, implying that it might carry distinct biological implications. However, the differences might also stem from the fact that affinity emphasizes global variance structures in the connectivity matrices. From a statistical perspective, calculating affinity from a correlation matrix naturally emphasizes the primary variance structure within that matrix, slightly attenuating the influence of lesser eigenvalues, effectively reducing its rank. This transformation of the connectivity matrix might serve as a form of noise reduction, explaining the stronger effects. In @suppfig-connvsaff, the two average cortical maps across the whole cohort for both measures are shown and affinity presents with a smoother surface as we would expect from noise reduction. In the main results presented we apply a 75% threshold to the connectivity matrix before calculating affinity, but our findings remain consistent even when using unthresholded affinity measures, as shown in @suppfig-affnothresh. -->

##### Gradient derivation {#sec-gradder}

Breaking down the connectivity matrices into low-dimensional components, known as gradients [@margulies2016], captures connectivity patterns of the brain as continuous measures of connectivity similarity over the cortex. Regions with similar connectivity patterns will get grouped together at different ends of these gradients. The primary components in such analysis represent the major variance axes of functional connectivity. For BioFINDER and ADNI, respectively, we calculated an estimate of the functional connectome by averaging individual connectivity matrices from cognitively unimpaired APOE ε4 non-carriers without abnormal Aβ levels. In BioFINDER, only younger participants (≤60 years) were included, whereas in ADNI, the entire age range was used due to the smaller available sample. The number of participants meeting this criteria was `r n_ave_conn_bf` for BioFINDER and `r n_ave_conn_adni` for ADNI.

The variance components, or gradients, of these two connectomes were derived using principal component analysis (PCA) with singular value decomposition directly on the connectome without thresholding. Traditionally, gradients are derived using diffusion map embedding [@coifman2005; @margulies2016], and involves applying heavy thresholding to the connectome before taking the pairwise cosine similarity of the rows/columns. However, we found that both methods produced comparable components with respect to the original gradients from @margulies2016 (accessed from https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:1598). We felt that applying PCA directly on the connectome, without transformation or thresholding, offered a simpler and more interpretable approach compared to diffusion map embedding, and did not result in a notable divergence. In Figure S9, we compare the two methods over a set of thresholding values, supporting this decision. Supplementary sensitivity analyses using gradients derived from both diffusion map embedding and PCA over different thresholds confirmed that this choice did not alter our results to any great extent, see Table S1.

### Statistical analyses

For the cross-sectional analyses, linear regression models were run for each parcel, with the functional connectivity metric as outcome, and the terms of interest as predictors, covaried for sex and motion. For example, for the analyses looking at age and AD pathology, the model formula was as follows: $FC_{parcel} \sim age + pathology + sex + motion$. This was repeated for each of the 1000 parcels. Obtained parcelwise t-values from each term were then correlated with the parcelwise component scores of the gradients, and the R² was calculated with 95% confidence intervals based on the non-centrality parameter of the F-distribution.

To investigate cross-sectional nonlinearities in the relationship between functional connectivity and age or pathology, generalized additive models (GAMs) with penalized regression splines (thin plate) were fitted for each parcel, with age and pathology as smooth terms and sex and motion as linear covariates ($FC_{parcel} \sim s(age) + s(pathology) + sex + motion$). The models were fitted using the R package mgcv (version 1.9-1, Wood 2011a), with default values for the number k basis functions. The first derivatives of the smooth terms were calculated at 100 evenly distributed points along each spectrum using finite differences, capturing the slope and effect direction at specific ages and pathology loads. For age, these derivatives were calculated over the central 90% of the range. These derivatives were then used to calculate R² values by correlating the slopes at each point with Gradient 1 (for pathology) or Gradient 3 (for age) scores. Gradient alignment could then be assessed continuously across the age and pathology spectra. To visualize these effects, derivatives were averaged over quartiles of pathology and age. The resulting average slopes were mapped onto the cortical surface. Additionally, FC metric predictions were generated across the same ranges, holding age constant at the sample mean (`r mean_age_bf`) when assessing pathology effects and pathology constant at 0.1 when assessing age effects. Parcels were grouped into 20 equally sized bins (ventiles) based on Gradient 1 (for pathology) or Gradient 3 (for age) scores, and predicted values within each ventile were averaged.

For the longitudinal analysis, linear mixed-effects models were fit at each parcel with FC as the outcome and baseline age, baseline pathology, and within-subject pathology change (Δ pathology) as fixed effects. Time between baseline and follow-up scan, sex and scanner motion were included as (fixed effects) covariates of no interest, and random intercepts were specified for subjects, i.e. $FC_{parcel} \sim age_{baseline} + pathology_{baseline} + \Delta pathology_{t_i-t_0} + time + sex + motion + (1 | subject)$. The within subject change in pathology was calculated as the difference between the baseline pathology score and the pathology score at each follow up timepoint for each individual. This approach separates the between and within subject effects. Obtained parcelwise t-values from each fixed effect of interest were then correlated with the parcelwise component scores of the gradients, and the R² calculated with 95% confidence intervals based on the non-centrality parameter of the F-distribution.

To assess nonlinear patterns of longitudinal change across the old age and AD pathology spectrum, we employed a sliding window approach. In this approach the model described in the previous paragraph was fitted at the parcel level repeatedly in windows traversing over baseline age and baseline pathology separately (i.e. age windows were only filtered on age and vice versa). Age windows were set at 25 years and incremented by 1 year, while pathology windows spanned 0.35 pathology score units and were incremented by 0.015, resulting in 44 and 45 windows respectively. Although relatively arbitrary, the window size of age was chosen to balance the number of subjects in each window, being sufficiently wide to capture the age effects we observed across the whole sample while being sufficiently narrow to capture nonlinearities across it. This window size turned out to be approximately 35% of the full age range, hence the pathology window was set at 35% of the pathology range \[0, 1\] as well. The pathology increment was chosen to get approximately the same number of windows as for age. Obtained t-values for each fixed effect of interest, in each window, were correlated with gradient scores. This allowed for a dynamic assessment of gradient alignment across both the baseline age and pathology spectra. The methodological workflow for the sliding window approach is presented in Figure 5B.

This table shows the main analyses from @fig-fig1 and @fig-cogfig using gradients derived with principal component analysis (PCA) or diffusion map embedding (DME) over four different thresholding values: 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75. A thresholding value of 0.75 means that 75% of the lowerst values in the connectivity matrix is zeroed out. In the columns Gradient 1 and Gradient 3, the R² with accompanying 95% confidence intervals are shown quantifying the relationship between the t-values for each specific term and the Gradient scores based on the derivation method and thresholding specified in those two columns. Gradients were derived in all analyses from the average connectome of individuals without cognitive impairment, apoe4 non-carriers without abnormal amyloid levels. In BioFINDER only individuals ≤60 years of age were included while in ADNI the whole age range was used due to the smaller sample size.

Analyses replicated with nodal connectivity strength (column-wise average of the unthresholded connectivity matrix) as the outcome measure demonstrates that age-related FC effects align with Gradient 3, while AD pathology-related effects align with Gradient 1, consistent with findings using nodal affinity in the main text (@fig-fig1 and @fig-cogfig). Results are shown for cross-sectional (A), longitudinal (B), and external replication (C). How cognitive status seem to modify these relationships are shown in (D) and (E). Cortical maps display t-values from nodal linear (or mixed-effects) models, while scatter plots show the relationships between t-values and gradient scores, colored by network membership, with R² values and their 95% parametric confidence intervals based on the F-distribution's non-centrality parameter.
